# Red (from Transistor)
### A mod for "Invisible, Inc." by Klei Entertainment

The aim of this mod is to add the character Red from the game Transistor by SuperGiantGames as a playable agent. 

## Installation

Download the files. If you intend to contribute, or update frequently, consider installing git on your computer and creating a local branch to pull to. (It's pretty straight-forward, look up some tutorials. I recommend using the "git GUI" application where possible.)

You may need to compile some files before the game can run this mod.
scripts.zip - Simply but all the contents of the "scripts" directory directly into a zip file with the same name.
KWAD files - Run the KWAD builder to generate a fresh KWAD file from the raw assets in this repository. View the official modding tutorials for more information.

This mod requires Sim Constructor by Cyberboy2000.
